In my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I learned to interpret user needs by gathering detailed requirements and creating user stories, which help break down tasks and prioritize them effectively. This approach ensures that the development aligns with user expectations. Developing programs involves using Agile processes like daily Scrum meetings, iterative development, and continuous feedback to adapt to changing requirements efficiently. In future development work, I hope to incorporate these Agile practices to maintain flexibility and deliver high-quality results. Being a good team member means communicating clearly, collaborating effectively, being reliable, adaptable, and respectful of others' contributions. These principles were crucial during the SNHU Travel project, ensuring our team worked cohesively and delivered a successful product.
